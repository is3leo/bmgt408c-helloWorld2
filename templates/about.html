                    Despite currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, the pursuit of my passion for design never ends, whether it be inside or outside of the classroom. At heart, I am an artist interested in the intersectionalities of identities and how people may present them. Through fashion, music, dance, and digital media, I seek how to blend various mediums as a means to capture moments of my ever-changing perspective on life simultaneously as I grow.

                    This website explores this vision through projects that range from a fashion magazine highlighting Asian American womanhood I produced for a capstone, to my critiques on art pieces and books that I've read. With a background rooted in both creativity and community, I am able to bring a strong work ethic, an attention to detail, and a deep appreciation for purposeful design. I hope to continue crafting visual narratives that empower underrepresented voices, and envision myself in roles where artistic expression merges with impact-driven storytelling.
